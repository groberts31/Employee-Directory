# Employee-Directory

![command line example](/empdir/public/images/screenshot.png)



## Overview

<p>This app is an employee directory with React. You will be able to view all employees within this directory and also sort by name through the input field located near the top of the page. When selecting an employee you will notice that it is case sensitive so if it doesn't directly match the employees name then the employee will not be found.</p>

## Business Context

<p>An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.</p>
